# Resturant
 My Restaurant Website

Hey there! This is a full front-end website I built for a modern restaurant using **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS**.

I wanted to create a clean and responsive design that looks good on all devices, with a nice layout for menus, food images, and booking options.
